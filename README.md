# mountain_lake_ice_phenology
This repository is for a project focused on Remotely Sensed Mountain Lake Ice Phenology. The scripts in this repository use Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data downloaded from Google Earth Engine (GEE). The GEE script extracts a time series of lake ice fractional coverage from which we derive ice phenology.
